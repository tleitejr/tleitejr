### About me

I’m a software developer who enjoys building **clean, scalable, and reliable systems**.  
Most of my work revolves around **backend development**, but I’m comfortable navigating the full stack when needed.

I care a lot about **code quality**, **good architecture**, and writing software that’s easy to maintain.  
I like understanding *why* things are built the way they are, not just *how*.

Currently focused on improving my skills in backend engineering, system integration, and cloud-ready applications.

### What I work with

- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot), NestJS  
- **Frontend:** Angular, React  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL  
- **Infrastructure & Messaging:** Docker, RabbitMQ  
- **Workflow:** Git, GitHub, Scrum, Kanban  

### A few things about me

- I enjoy working in collaborative, product-focused teams  
- I value simple solutions over complex ones  
- I’m constantly learning and refining my skills  
- I like building things that solve real problems  

*Always open to interesting projects and good conversations.*
